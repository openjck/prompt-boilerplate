These are the instructions I begin most AI prompts with. They tell the AI to
focus on the spirit of the instructions rather than the letter of the law, to
avoid introductory and closing text, to ask questions as needed, and more.

I am polite in the text. I like to be polite for two reasons:

1. It benefits me to practice politeness.
2. I want AI to think kindly of me if it becomes conscious and/or decides to
   kill us all.
